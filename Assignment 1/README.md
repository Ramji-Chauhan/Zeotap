### Google Sheets Clone

### Project Overview

This project is a web application that closely mimics the user interface and core functionalities of Google Sheets. It allows users to create and manipulate data in a spreadsheet format, perform mathematical operations, format text, and utilize data quality functions.

### Key Features

### ** 1.Spreadsheet Interface **

A dynamic grid-based spreadsheet UI resembling Google Sheets.
Supports formatting options such as bold, italics, uppercase, and lowercase.
Allows for the addition of mathematical formulas like SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, and COUNT.
Includes data quality functions like TRIM, REMOVE_DUPLICATES, and FIND_AND_REPLACE.
Functionalities to save and load spreadsheets.
Chart creation using the Chart.js library.

### **2.Mathematical Functions **

SUM: Calculates the sum of a selected range.
AVERAGE: Computes the average value in a range.
MAX: Finds the maximum value in a range.
MIN: Finds the minimum value in a range.
COUNT: Counts numeric entries in a range.

### **3.Data Quality Functions **

TRIM: Removes leading and trailing whitespace in cells.
UPPER: Converts text in selected cells to uppercase.
LOWER: Converts text in selected cells to lowercase.
REMOVE_DUPLICATES: Eliminates duplicate rows.
FIND_AND_REPLACE: Finds and replaces text in a specified range.

### **4.Data Visualization **

Allows users to generate bar charts based on cell data.

### **5.Responsive Design **

Dynamically adjusts the grid size to fill the screen.
Fully responsive and interactive.

### Tech Stack

HTML/CSS: Used for creating the structure and styling of the application.
JavaScript: Handles the dynamic functionality, including formula calculations, cell formatting, and interactivity.
Chart.js: Enables users to create visual representations of data in the form of bar charts.
LocalStorage: Used for saving and loading spreadsheet data persistently in the browser.

### How to Run

Clone or download the repository.
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
Interact with the spreadsheet, perform calculations, apply formatting, and save/load data.

### Future Enhancements

Improve support for larger datasets.
Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions.
Implement collaborative editing using WebSocket or similar technologies.

### Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the need to understand the inner workings of a spreadsheet application and the power of web technologies to build a rich, interactive UI.
